# odin-homepage

Odin Homepage is a toy project that puts in use the learnings from Odin's Foundation course (upto 60% completion).

Odin Homepage is a webpage with a modern design sense that is achieved through the use of flexbox.

This is not a portfolio piece. This is simply a practise project to brush up basic CSS knowledge.
